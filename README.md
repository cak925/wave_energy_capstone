Galvanize Capstone Project: Forecasting Wave Energy along the Northern California Coast


One of the major issues in integrating renewable energy into the electrical grid is uncertainty with short-term forecasts, and knowing in advance when an increase in electricity is on the way is an important part of the assimilation process. While wind and solar have been leading sources of renewable energy, waves are increasingly being recognized as a viable source of power for coastal regions. It turns out, the energy produced by waves is a lot easier to forecast than energy produced by wind or the sun. In my project, I use data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to predict certain wave properties that dictate the amount of usable energy generated by a specific wave energy converter, The Pelamis.  I will also analyze past data to see how much energy could have been contributed to California’s electrical grid with one of these wave energy ‘farms’, consisting of forty of these machines.
